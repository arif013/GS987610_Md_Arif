# DATA VIEWER APP

## Run the code

To run the frontend of the project in localhost follow the below steps

Step1:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/arif013/GS987610_Md_Arif.git
```
Then as it clones the project, follow the step 2

Step 2:
```bash
    npm install
```
This installs all the packages, and finally

Step 3:
```bash
    npm run dev
```  
# Testing The Output

After running it locally provide the below auth credentials in the login page  
```
    email: mdarif@gmail.com
    password: Password@123
```
This will take you to the Data Viewer page where you can check the data, Add new Data, Edit existing data and delete; all the CRUD operations can be performed.

## Listing Elements

- A clean UI
- Nice representation of the Data Grid
- A proper authentication using JWT token with protected routes
- Code reusability and it is scalable at any time

## What if I have another few hours
Things I would improve if I had 4 hours more:
- Better optimization in React application by using more code reusability
- Adding animation using Framer motion
- Here I only used local data and those are very few from the local file, but in case of extra time I'd implement an extra function which is CSV to JSON converter to all the CSV files and then after having the parsed data I will use that in the fields.
- And an final option I'd provide for the user is to download the data from the UI.
